Go to branches for the codes

Checkpoint 1:
  
  Task A1: The first task is all about library pandas. We were given a dataset and were asked to some basic things related to pandas which we learned during our phase 1.
  
  Task A2:Second task was related to matplotlib library. Again we were given a dataset and were supposed to do some basic plotting using matplotlib
  
  Task B2: This was sort of basic application based task. This task involves seaborn library . The task was to plot the dataset and interpret some results regarding the dataset              from the plotting.
  
Checkpoint 2:
  
  Task B3: phase 2 was more intended towards neural networks and open CV .This task combines both of the previous mentioned topics and creates a basic live gender and age                    predication program. We used some pre trained models and implemented in our codes and used open cv to take live feed from the webcam and predicts gender and age.
  
  Task B4:This task is a modified version of the aboe task. This task takes a youtube video link and predicts gender and age rather than using local webcam . Again this code                 includes basic use of neural networks and open CV.
  
  
Checkpoint 3:
  
  Task C2:This task is basically our main project. It recognizes the image of a person(s) which you have pre trained. This code askes you to choos between google images or your           own personal google drive images which ever you want to pre train. It takes the names of the people whose images you want pre train, trains the model,tests the model and           finally askes you to uload a photo or a video.If it is a photo,it will recognize the person. If it is a video it will group all the different people in the video and               show it to you as a group of photos.
  
  Task A5:This is a simple task which takes a photo as a input and predicts the emotion of the person in the photo.
          PS:You will need to download train and test models for this code from kaggle.
